## Why DOS 16 bit?

Having recently aquired a couple of IBM XT 5160 machines I was looking into the best way to create and cross-compile software for this wonderful old machine and its kind.

## Usage

Clone it, compile it, play with it...

My steep learning curve.

## How do I get setup?

Option 1: Run the executable files in DOSBOX our on your own old iron hardware.
