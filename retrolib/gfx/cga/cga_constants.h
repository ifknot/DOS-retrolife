 *  @brief     CGA macro definitions for assembly
 *  @details   Everything is hard coded to shave a few clock cycles off the execution time
 *  Using #define enables immediate addressing mode - in which the data operand is a part of the instruction itself
 *  This matters on an 8088 where reg,imm is only 4 clock cycles as opposed to 12+EA for reg,mem
 *  This advantage dwindles on the 286 (2:5) and 386 (2:4), vanishing on the 486(1:1) and beyond
