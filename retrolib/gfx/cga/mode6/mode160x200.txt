If you connect a CGA to a composite monitor, put it in 640x200 mode and turn the black-and-white mode off, you may (depending on the monitor) get a 160x200 colour graphics mode. Some CGA programs, including the Microsoft Flight Simulator, support this mode.


A byte roughly corresponds to two pixels, with each nibble giving the colour of one pixel. The colours visible in this mode are different from the normal CGA set; the ones I get are:

0: Black
1: Dark green
2: Blue
3: Cyan
4: Crimson
5: Dark brownish grey
6: Magenta
7: Violet
8: Dark grey
9: Bright Green
10: Light brownish grey
11: Bright Cyan
12: Scarlet
13: Yellow
14: Hot Pink
15: White

I've found that CGA cards fall into three categories:

[1] Some have a really lousy RGB->composite color converter. When bit 2 of
port $3D8 is clear, colored characters will get ugly vertical stripes
though them [modulated at 3.58Mhz]; note that when in "high-bandwidth"
modes [e.g. 80x25 text or 160x100x16 lo-res] the colorburst signal at
the start of each line is invariably botched; if you want color in those
modes, you must set the border to color #6. Alternatively, if bit 2 of
port $3D8 is set, the card will generate monochrome; note that some cards
do better at this than others, but the monochrome is usually of pretty
good quality and often can provide a 16-level grayscale [though not in
color #0-#15 order]

If you are writing your own software, you will probably get the best
results by using 640x200 mode and clearing bit 2 of port $3D8. Working
left to right, illunimated pixels will be [if memory serves], brown,
magenta, green, blue, brown, magenta, etc. and nearby pixels may be
combined to produce colors. For example, illunimating columns 0, 1, 4,
5, 8, etc. would produce a region of orange. Anyone who has done color
on the Apple //e will be familiar with these techniques and while they
may seem strange they actually work quite well; the effective horizontal
resolution will vary from 160x200 to 640x200 depending upon what colors
are being juxtaposed. Generally this mode works best for combining a
160x200 16-color picture with 40-column text [which may be white on black,
brown, dark-magenta, dark-green, dark-blue, or gray; or black on white,
yellow, light-magenta, light-green, light-blue, or gray].

[2] Some have a monochrome RGB->composite color converter. These are gen-
erally decent and operate as if bit 2 of port $3D8 was simply stuck high
all the time.

[3] Some have no composite video output whatsoever.

Note that visual inspection cannot easily tell you into which category a card
falls; even the lack of an RCA jack won't tell you, since some cards have no
such jack but output composite video on pin 7 of the DB9.
