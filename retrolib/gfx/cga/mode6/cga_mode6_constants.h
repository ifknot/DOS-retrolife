 /**
  * Mode 6 macro definitions for assembly
  * 
  * Graphic Mode: 640x200, 1-bit Color - few programs used this mode because it was monochrome, but the higher resolution allowed for more detailed interfaces. 
  * The resolution is 640x200 pixels, but has a dramatic pixel ratio of 1:2.4 (visually 640x480). 
  * When displayed on a CRT monitor, the display was visibly stretched in height, scanlines would be present, and a curved distortion would be noticeable near the edges of the display. 
  * Games like SimCity supported this mode.
  *
  * Everything is hard coded to shave a few clock cycles off the execution time
  * Using #define enables immediate addressing mode - in which the data operand is a part of the instruction itself
  * This matters on an 8088 where reg,imm is only 4 clock cycles as opposed to 12+EA for reg,mem
  * This advantage dwindles on the 286 (2:5) and 386 (2:4), vanishing on the 486(1:1) and beyond
