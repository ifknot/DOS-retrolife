 *  @brief     
 * @details    Most MDA clones implement some form of Hercules-compatible graphics. The main differences for a Hercules-compatible card are:
 * + Writing to port 03BFh enables extra bits in the Mode Control register at 03B8h:
 *              Set bit 0 of 3BFh to enable bit 1 of 3B8h
 *              Set bit 1 of 3BFh to enable bit 7 of 3B8h and the second 32k of RAM ("Full" mode).
 * + Writing to port 03B8h has these extra effects (assuming the appropriate bits have previously been enabled):
 *              If bit 1 is set, graphics mode is selected.
 *              If bit 7 is set, the graphics frame buffer is at 0B8000h. Otherwise it's at 0B000h.
 * + In "full" mode, an Hercules card occupies memory between 0B0000h and 0BFFFFh, for two frame buffers.
 * + In "half" mode, only one frame buffer is present, from 0B0000h to 0B7FFFh; this allows the card to be used in a dual-head configuration.
 * + Reading from port 03BAh returns vertical sync in bit 7, and a card ID in bits 6-4:
 *              000: Hercules
 *              001: Hercules Plus
 *              101: Hercules InColor
 *              111: Unknown clone (see below)
 * @note Only trust this ID once you've checked that there's a vertical sync present; if bit 7 is the same for 32768 reads in succession, then there isn't.
 * + Some Hercules cards support a light pen.
 *              Port 3BAh bit returns the lightpen sensor status.
 *      Port 3BBh any write resets the light pen status.
 * One card I have encountered, which appears to be a Hercules clone of Eastern European origin, has a further capability - two ROM fonts, selectable in software.
 * These options are controlled in a similar manner to other extended features in the Hercules:
 *              Bit 2 of port 3BFh must be set to enable the feature
 *              Bit 4 of port 3B8h selects which font to use.
 * The card ID in bits 6-4 of port 03BAh has all three bits set.

          *  @note 2. The values are somewhat larger in reality but provides reliable upper and lower bounds.
          *  @note 3. The imprecision makes detection less reliable on HCG+ and InColor cards due to differing values for the differing character sizes these cards offer
